# Template for all commits

Before pushing, make sure to pull all changes from origin and MERGE

Each commit message should be formatted with the following template:
- Commit Name: Ticket/Feature Name + Changes
- [Ticket] (Ticket/Feature Name + What you did to it)
- What changes you made to each file

Testing should also be included in each commit

- [Testing] (Link videos/description of any demoing you have done)
